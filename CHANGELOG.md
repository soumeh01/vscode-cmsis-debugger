  - Fixes [#128](https://github.com/Open-CMSIS-Pack/vscode-cmsis-debugger/issues/128): Programming fails on LPC55S69
   when device is erased. Debugger no longer reads back programmed flash memory if `Verify` function is
   provided by flash algorithm.
  - Fixes [#131](https://github.com/Open-CMSIS-Pack/vscode-cmsis-debugger/issues/131):
   AP access failure due to invalid security flags (SPROT).
  - Extends support for `*.cbuild-run.yml` debug configuration files.

## 0.0.2
